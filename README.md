# Introduction

The S&P 500, a benchmark index comprising 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States, serves as a crucial indicator of the overall health of the U.S. stock market and economy. For our Summer 2024 Data Science Project, we aim to leverage historical S&P 500 stock market data to predict future stock prices and analyze the performance of different sectors within the index. By employing advanced machine learning techniques, we seek to answer two primary questions: "Can we accurately predict future stock prices based on historical data?" and "How do different sectors within the S&P 500 compare in terms of performance over time?"

Answering these questions holds significant importance for both investors and analysts. Accurate stock price predictions can inform investment strategies, helping individuals and institutions make more informed decisions and potentially increase their returns. Additionally, understanding sector performance can provide insights into economic trends, guiding policy-making and investment allocations. By exploring these questions, our project not only showcases the practical applications of data science in finance but also contributes valuable knowledge to the field of financial analytics.
